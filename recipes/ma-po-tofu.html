    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Mapo Tofu is a classic dish from Sichuan cuisine, celebrated for its bold,
      spicy, and numbing flavors. It features soft tofu cubes simmered in a
      rich, oily chili-bean sauce, accompanied by minced pork or beef, and
      topped with Sichuan peppercorns for a signature tingling sensation. The
      dish strikes a beautiful balance between savory, spicy, and aromatic
      notes, making it a favorite both in Chinese households and in restaurants
      worldwide.

    <p>
      The name “Mapo” roughly translates to “pockmarked old woman,” referencing
      the original creator of the dish in 19th-century Chengdu. Today, it is
      known for its comforting warmth and fiery kick. When served over steamed
      rice, it becomes a satisfying, deeply flavorful meal that showcases the
      essence of Sichuan culinary tradition.
