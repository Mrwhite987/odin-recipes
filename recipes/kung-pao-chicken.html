    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Kung Pao Chicken is a classic Sichuan-style stir-fry dish that combines
      tender diced chicken with crunchy peanuts, dried chili peppers, and a
      savory-sweet sauce. It's known for its bold, complex flavor profile—spicy,
      slightly numbing from Sichuan peppercorns, and balanced with a hint of
      sweetness and tang from vinegar and sugar. The dish is not only a staple
      in Chinese restaurants worldwide but also a beloved home-cooked favorite
      across China.
    </p>
    <p>
      Traditionally, Kung Pao Chicken is made with marinated chicken thighs for
      a juicier texture, quickly stir-fried over high heat to retain moisture
      and crunch. The addition of vegetables like bell peppers or scallions is
      sometimes used, especially in Western versions, but the authentic Sichuan
      rendition keeps it simple, focusing on the harmony between the sauce, the
      chicken, and the spice.
